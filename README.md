# SonarHunt
Very simple console game: Find an enemy submarine in dephts of the ocean using pings, only!

## Platforms
Unfortunately, Windows only, at the moment...

## Purpose
This is a simple game to pick up game programming in C#. Actually, it doesn't take much to get something
really cool going!

## Features
* Console game interface
* ASCII splash screen
* User input
* Sound output
* Special effect: Teletype'd text (it looks so cool with a green-on-black Windows Terminal with retro terminal effects enabled!)
## Compiling
* Make sure you use VS 2022at minimum, and have the language support for C# installed
* The resources (sound files) live in the project, so a launchSettings.json has been added to make sure they are found
